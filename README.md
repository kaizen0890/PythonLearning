# PythonLearning
## About me

My name is Nguyen Huy Thanh, english name: Thomas Nguyen, chinese name: 阮輝青. I'm embedded software engineering in Vietnam
About my degree, I got master of computer science in NATIONAL KAOHSIUNG UNIVERSITY OF APPLIED SCIENCES (Taiwan). In Taiwan, my research major is computer vison, pattern classification and machine-learning. After graduated, i backed to Vietnam and worked in Foxconn coporation's RD office. In here, my work is embedded system developing. 
Although now i'm working in different field but i still very passionate in my researching field before, especially machine-learning and deep-learning. I wish that in near furture i will work in my expecting major, therefore now i spend a lot of time to self-learning about machine-learning and deep learning

## What is it?

This is my multi-month study plan for going from software engineering (self-taught) to machine learning engineer.
My main goal was to find an approach to studying more deeply about Machine Learning that is mainly hands-on and abstracts most of the Math for the beginner. This approach is unconventional because it’s the top-down and results-first approach designed for software engineers.

## What's my plan?

The following is my self-study machine-learning plan. It's divided to some stages, each stage i will prepare knowledge and programing skill for next stage. Every stage has Goals and Expected time, i will try my best to follow and finish it.

1. Stage 1: learning Python. 
   - Goals: 
     - Basic understanding about python language: function, class, variable, list, dictionary, loop, classes, file and exceptions
     - Create a small project which uses almost basic python knowledge (Object-Oriented-Programming)
     - Reference documents: Python Crash Course-Eric Matthes (good book), Learn Python the hard-way.
     - Expected time: 1 week
2. Stage 2: learning Python with Opencv
   - Goals: 
      - Learning all basic opencv function
      - Practice opencv with python: object detection, temple matching, fourier transform, SIFT&SURF, extracting contour, image segmentation (Superpixel-SLIC), face detection using haar cascade ...
      - Pattern recognition: human face, OCR, object recognition
      - Transfer all before computer science programs from C/C++ to Python
   - Reference documents: Python with computer science, face recognition on python
   - Expected time: 2 weeks
3. Stage 3: Machine learning with Python
   This stage need to divide to major plans, i will learning two plan at the same time. It's will take a long time to learn but i think it's suit to me. Because you can not deeply understand mathematic algorithm or theories without practice. In contrast, you also aren't able to resolve machine-learning problem without understanding about theories. Therefore, "Study goes as a pair with practice" in this case is necessary ^^!
   * Plan 1: Learning advanced python
      - Goals: 
            - Skilled program with Numpy, Sci-kit learn libraries
            - Working with data science using python
            - Finish Python Crash Course-Eric Matthes and Learn Python the hard-way books
            - Apply python to program basic mathematic: basic machine learning, statistic (mean, variance, standard deviation, etc.), Linear algebra (vectors, matrices, etc.), Calculus (differentiation, integration, partial derivatives, etc.)
      - Reference documents: 
   * Plan 2: Start to learning machine learning
      - Goals: 
            - Understanding about basic machine learning algorithms
            - Understanding data science
            - Understanding Pattern-Classification theory
            - Practice Sci-kit and Tensor-flow to machine learning
            - Can understanding and following some machine-learning course on Coursera
      - Reference documents: 
            - Machine Learning cơ bản - Vu Huu Tiep
            - (https://huytd.github.io/posts/machine-learning-deep-learning.html)
            - (https://github.com/ZuzooVn/machine-learning-for-software-engineers)
            - Some important machine learning course on Coursera by Andrew Ng
            - Mathematic for computer science
            - Linear algebra and its applications
            - Theory of matrics
            - Data Science from Scratch
            - Machinelearning in Python
            - Pattern-Classification 
            - Understanding machine learning theory algorithms
       - Expected time: TBD
