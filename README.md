# PythonLearning
## About me

My name is Nguyen Huy Thanh, english name: Thomas Nguyen, chinese name: 阮輝青. I'm embedded software engineering in Vietnam
About my degree, I got master of computer science in NATIONAL KAOHSIUNG UNIVERSITY OF APPLIED SCIENCES (Taiwan). In Taiwan, my research major is computer vison, pattern classification and machine-learning. After graduated, i backed to Vietnam and worked in Foxconn coporation's RD office. In here, my work is embedded system developing. 
Although now i'm working in different field but i still very passionate in my researching field before, especially machine-learning and deep-learning. I wish that in near furture i will work in my expecting major, therefore now i spend a lot of time to self-learning about machine-learning and deep learning

## What is it?

This is my learning python project. With this project, i will learn by my self about Python programming, after that, i will transfer my before Computer Vision C++ programs (which used Opencv library) to python language. Next stage, i;ll take advance python programming session with Machine Learning and Deep Learning in Machine Learning project. Thanks for watching!
